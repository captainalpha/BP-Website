            BPAAS BillSmart solution delivers functionality of Accounts Payable.
            It provides functionality by which payables processes are handled
            digitally by using BPAAS solutions, rather than manually. BillSmart
            revolutionizes the way businesses process and pay their invoices.
            The solution covers receipt of invoices through different channels
            like email, by hand, and by vendor portal. Once invoices have been
            received, BPAAS integrated extraction engine runs OCR on these
            invoices to extract data and pushes invoices in to workflow system
            of BillSmart for further approvals. The system can be integrated
            with back end ERPâ€™s for validations and other checks related to
            2-way or 3-way matches. The solution delivers improved efficiency,
            increased accuracy and adhere to compliances of the organization.
            The ROI of this solution reduced invoice processing cost, fewer
            vendor queries and increase chances of early payment discounts.
